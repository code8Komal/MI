    "##### The filter method is a technique used in feature selection, which is a process of selecting a subset of relevant features (variables, attributes) from a larger set of features to be used in building a predictive model or conducting an analysis. The filter method involves evaluating the importance or relevance of individual features independently of any specific machine learning algorithm. It's called a \"filter\" because it acts as a preprocessing step to filter out features that may be less informative or redundant before feeding the data into a machine learning algorithm.\n"

    "## Sensitivity to Data Scaling: \n",
    "Many filter methods rely on measures like correlation or mutual information, which can be sensitive to the scale of the data. If features have different scales, this can bias feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limited to Univariate Analysis: \n",
    "Filter methods typically perform univariate feature selection, meaning they assess each feature in isolation. They may not consider the combined impact of multiple features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ineffective for Complex Relationships:\n",
    "When the relationships between features and the target variable are non-linear, the filter method might not be effective at capturing these relationships. It may remove potentially valuable features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## May Remove Features Too Aggressively:\n",
    "Filter methods often use a fixed threshold or ranking to select features. This can lead to the exclusion of features that, while not highly ranked in isolation, contribute positively when combined with other features.\n",

    "## Loss of Context: \n",
    "The filter method may not consider the overall context of the problem. Some seemingly irrelevant features might provide important context or domain-specific information that could be valuable for certain tasks.\n",

    "## No Model Performance Consideration:\n",
    "Filter methods do not directly consider the impact of feature selection on model performance. The selection criterion is not based on how well the features contribute to the predictive power of a model.\n",

    "## Wrapper Method Feature Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the Wrapper method for feature selection as follows:\n",
    "#### a. Forward Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin with an empty set of selected features.\n",
    "Train the chosen machine learning model on the dataset using each individual feature separately and evaluate the model's performance using cross-validation or a validation dataset.\n",
    "Select the feature that results in the best model performance according to the chosen evaluation metric.\n",
    "Add this feature to the set of selected features.\n",
    "Repeat the process by considering the addition of one more feature at a time and selecting the one that contributes the most to model improvement.\n",
    "Continue this process until adding more features does not significantly improve the model's performance or until you reach a predefined number of features or a specific performance threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. Backward Elimination:\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with all features included in the set.\n",
    "Train the machine learning model on the dataset using all features and evaluate its performance.\n",
    "Remove the feature that contributes the least to the model's performance based on the chosen evaluation metric.\n",
    "Repeat this process iteratively until removing more features does not significantly worsen the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE):\n",
    "\n",
    "RFE is a variant of the backward elimination method that automates the process. It iteratively trains the model, evaluates feature importance, and removes the least important feature until the desired number of features is reached or a specified performance threshold is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evaluate Model Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assess the performance of your model using the selected features on a validation dataset or through cross-validation, and evaluate it using the chosen evaluation metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterate and Refine:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the initial model's performance is unsatisfactory, you can iterate the feature selection process by adjusting the number of selected features, trying different algorithms, or fine-tuning model hyperparameters to improve predictive accuracy.\n",
    "Deploy the Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are satisfied with the model's performance, you can deploy it for predicting house prices using the selected features.\n",
    "The Wrapper method is an iterative approach to feature selection that systematically evaluates different subsets of features within the context of the chosen machine learning model. It helps you select the most important features while considering their combined impact on model performance, ensuring that you build an accurate house price prediction model.\n",
